# Transfer Learning Thesis
### A thesis on Transfer Learning for Human Action Recognition

> In the field of Machine Learning, Transfer Learning of Neural Networks involves using a trained Neural Network Machine Learning model to be trained again on a new dataset, so that the model can be used to infer on newer related dataset. The proposed work compares various pre-trained Neural Network models such as VGG16, ResNet50, Inception-V3 and MobileNet for transfer learning in Human Action Recognition. Transfer Learning have been performed on the above models and the models have been compared on the factors â€“ accuracy, loss, storage size, number of parameters, architecture etc.

- Performed comprehensive comparison of transfer learning models.
- The transfer learning models were trained with dataset for Human Action Recognition.
- Submitted Dissertation as part of University of London Graduation for Master of Science in Data Science degree.

> Pre-trained models are frequently used as the foundation for deep learning tasks in computer vision and natural language processing due to the enormous time and computing resources needed to develop neural network models for these problems as well as the enormous gains in performance they offer on related problems
